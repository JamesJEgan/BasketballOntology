# BasketballOntology
*This repo is a work in progress*

This is an ontology of basketball related terms. This ontology is an extension of the Common Core Ontologies Suite. At this stage of design, the ontology serves as a means to think through BFO/CCO classes and relations by applying them to basketball related terms. The evetual goal is to create an adequate ontology to use with player and team statistics of NBA games.
